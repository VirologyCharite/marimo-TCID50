# TCID50 calculation using marimo
This repo contains a simple marimo notebook to perform logistic regression on a set of virus dilutions and determine the 50% infectious dose (TCID50) for each. The notebook takes an excel table as its input and outputs a csv with the suffix _output containing the caluclated values. For further documentation open the notebook in marimo.
